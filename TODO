Instead of reading the socket blindly and assuming the next packet in 
queue is the right one...:

 - create a thread that will do nothing but interact with the socket,
   read and populate two queues:
     - send_queue
     - receive_queue
   in each of these will be fully decoded header + data packets

 - tick every 200ms and monitor the queues

 - still no idea on how to "add" a break point, but in the mean time, if
   you can request to listen to some events and receive then asynchronously,
   it will be a good step forward.
